We also add a \"hint\" to the correct solution via the chunk immediate below labeled `print-limit-hint`.*\n\nModify the following code to limit the number of rows printed to 5:\n\n```{r print-limit, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=TRUE}\nmtcars\n```\n\n```{r print-limit-hint}\nhead(mtcars)\n```\n\n### Quiz\n\n*You can include any number of single or multiple choice questions as a quiz. Use the `question` function to define a question and the `quiz` function for grouping multiple questions together.*\n\nSome questions to verify that you understand the purposes of various base and recommended R packages:\n\n```{r quiz}\nquiz(\n  question(\"Which package contains functions for installing other R packages?\",\n    answer(\"base\"),\n    answer(\"tools\"),\n    answer(\"utils\", correct = TRUE),\n    answer(\"codetools\")\n  ),\n  question(\"Which of the R packages listed below are used to create plots?\",\n    answer(\"lattice\", correct = TRUE),\n    answer(\"tools\"),\n    answer(\"stats\"),\n    answer(\"grid\", correct = TRUE)\n  )\n)\n```\n\n",
